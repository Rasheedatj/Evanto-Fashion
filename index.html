          I began acquired his love for fashion when he was a young boy where he

          While in New York, I was employed in the Charivari Boutique where
          president of the company, Barbara Weiser, noticed my potential and
          passion for unique fashion and helped me launch my first fashion
          collection. My passion for African fashion is profound. “Everything
          begins for me with the print and fabric, which usually has some
          shine,” exclaims Faturoti. My deep African roots, as well as extensive
          global experience with having lived and worked in New York and Milan
          have been instrumental in her success and international spotlight.

          My pieces are also sold globally in the UK, US, and France. Anthony
          uses his talent to make an impact on the community through a mentoring
          program he runs that helps young and upcoming Nigerian designers excel
          and compete on a global platform. Nature, colors, and artwork are his
          main sources of inspiration.
